# Elastic_buffer
Elastic buffer for Eridan Pre - screening Test

Design folder contains buffer design written in System Verilog as well as testbench buffer.

Docs folder contains short documentation with block diagram image and short funcionality description.

XSim folder contains sources and scripts for running simulation from Linux based distributions ( Tested on Ubuntu). To run simulation scripts open terminal and position yourself in xsim folder. Run script.sh simply by writing ./script.sh. For that you need to have Vivado 2020.2 or newer installed ( Tested on 2020.2v). Probably should work on some older too. If script fails with message "SOURCING ENV FAILED, CHECK PATH IN SCRIPT" you need to change path in script to your settings64.sh script that's located in your Vivado installation folder.
